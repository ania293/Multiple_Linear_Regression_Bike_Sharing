Background

Bike-sharing systems represent a modern approach to traditional bike rentals, automating the entire process from membership to rental and return. With these systems, users can conveniently rent a bike from one location and return it to another.

Data Set

The rental process of bike-sharing is closely linked to environmental and seasonal factors. Weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, and time of day all influence rental behaviors. The primary dataset consists of a two-year historical log covering the years 2011 and 2012 from the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington D.C., USA, which is publicly accessible at http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. The data is aggregated on both an hourly and daily basis and supplemented with corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather data is sourced from http://www.freemeteo.com.

Machine Learning Problem

Prediction of bike rental counts on an hourly and daily basis, taking into account seasonal and environmental factors.
